#1. Just double click on FlightAerodynamicSimulator.exe and execute it.
#2. voice-FLIGHT AERODYNAMICS APP FOR AIRCRAFT DESIGN.mp4
#3. voice-flight-aerodynamic-simulation.mp4

Please watch these videos and you will be able to understand how it runs.

#4. I seek some contribution to sustain my development activity.
    If possible make some contribution from your end to this project. I am
    trying to shape it better for Technical Aerodynamic calculation...
#5  I need some financial support for this activity that's why I am giving
    here my banking id and online PayPal IDs. If you help I can better 
    survive with my personal life and technical activity. Thanks a lot
    in advance.

#6. For any queries: please contact me below.

About this tool:
#1.  This tool is designed mainly to meet Aerodynamic coefficients, and aerodynamic characteristics
     for meeting or designing a flying machine or aircraft.
#2.  During this course of designing geometry, grid and solver for finding flow parameters.
#3.  Finally we start Aerodynamic calculations for our expected design and conform to the shape and geometry.
